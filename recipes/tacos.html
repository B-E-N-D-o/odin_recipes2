        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make beer batter: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir into flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make white sauce: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalape√±o, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip floured fish pieces into beer batter. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry in hot oil until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Lightly fry tortillas in hot oil until just crisped, but not too crisp. Drain on paper towels.

        <li>
            Place fried fish in tortillas; top with shredded cabbage and white sauce.
